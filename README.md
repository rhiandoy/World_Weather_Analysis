## Overview of Project

In this project, a weather database was created as an aid to those planning a vacation. By using an API call through Google's cloud platform, 2000 latitude and longitude points were generated for the new database. This holds information on randomly selected cities all over the world including their current weather description, maximum temperatures, and even generates a nearby hotel. 
This information is represented in a marker layer map with pop-ups for each mark. Using Google Directions API, a travel itinerary was created to map out the route of four possible vacation destinations in one country. Within the code, users are able to select a minimum and maximum temperature preference to narrow their destination selection.
